# Hackaton-Marmiton

This was done in a hackathon. The goal was to scrape marmiton.org for a few hundred recipes and try and find interesting patterns.

Selenium and BS4 were used for webscraping

We used NLP to scour through ingredients and instructions in popular recipes for Valentine's Day.

We also used the dates on comments to look for the time that people tend to look for those recipes.
(Interestingly enough, it's more in December than in February).

Finally, we tried to use Deep Learning to predict the grade of a recipe based on hypothetical ingredients, cost, difficulty, preparation time, cooking time,...

Created a streamlit app to see the results.

For now only the neural network and the streamlit app are here.
The rest will come soon.
